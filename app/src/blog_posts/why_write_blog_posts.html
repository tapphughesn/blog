<h1>Why Write Blog Posts?</h1>
<span>October 12<sup>th</sup> 2025 &middot; 8 minute read</span>
<p>If you are a technical person who builds solutions, works on projects, and learns new things all the time, you may be
    familiar with the feeling that some of your work doesn’t seem to have a whole lot of impact. You studied hard to
    pass the final exam in that super interesting course you took, but you eventually forgot all that stuff and the only
    lasting impact was a small increase to your GPA. You worked on that personal project for months, and while the
    solution you came up with works well and the project was successful, its lasting legacy is as a line item in your CV
    and a GitHub repo that a few folks scan through. You spent a chapter of your career working on a customer-facing
    project, but outside of your manager and a few folks close to the project, no one really understands what you
    actually <em>did</em>. Yes, all of those results are valuable and expected--those are the things people do to build
    a successful career. But is that really all that you can get? </p>
<p>Enter blog posts. A blog allows you to take all of those efforts and package them into a record of timeless stories
    that others can read and understand. By expending a relatively small amount of effort to write a public post, you’ve
    transformed the potential reach of your work from a small group of people at a specific moment in time to
    <em>everyone, forever</em>. An especially important member of this audience is your future self, who will probably
    want to revisit the clear thinking of your present self, who knows the most about whatever you are working on now.
    By writing blog posts about your work, you are making information much more <em>accessible</em> than it could have
    been without the post. But, it gets even better--writing the blog gets you a few more concrete benefits that are
    explained below.
</p>
<h2>Learning and Teaching</h2>
<p>Anyone who has spent some time on YouTube can probably attest that unstructured consumption of information can be an
    absolute blast. Guided by pure curiosity, you take in books, articles, educational videos, etc. as you please,
    jumping to new topics as easily as a squirrel jumps between trees. While this can be fun, it usually isn’t
    <em>useful</em>, at least in the sense that it won’t significantly develop your ability to solve problems. True
    learning requires structured goals. You must <em>apply </em>what you’ve learned, usually in the form of an exam,
    task, or deliverable<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. It is commonly known that the
    ability to <em>teach</em> a lesson is the marker of whether you have learned it. You must take in and you must put
    out--both parts of this cycle are necessary for individual learning and growth to take place.
</p>
<p>There are of course many ways to apply something you’ve learned, but few are as effective as writing educational blog
    posts. The best educational blog posts do a good job of organizing the relevant information the author has learned,
    thus efficiently teaching the reader. If your goal is to write blog posts that actually do a good job of teaching,
    your learning process drastically changes for the better. You are more focused on the particular subject at hand and
    more driven to fully understand it--otherwise your misunderstanding will become apparent in your writing. If you
    have already learned something significant, as technical people are often doing, then this should not be a huge
    undertaking. In writing the blog post, you must use your understanding to deliver a straightforward, useful, and
    appealing lesson, so that the reader will actually want to consume it. If you have done that, you have achieved two
    simultaneous goals: you have solidified your learning and your reader has learned it too--how great is that!</p>
<h2>Turning Projects into Stories</h2>
<p>Completing technical projects is the core of what software developers (and many other professionals) do, and writing
    blog posts about those projects is a helpful augmentation of that function. Unlike the unstructured information
    consumption process I described above, completing a project has a useful impact in and of itself; you don’t need to
    write a blog post about the project to make it useful and complete. In doing the project, you have already delivered
    something, and you’ve learned and grown along the way.</p>
<p>However, if you can, I think it’s worth your time to write a blog post about it. A blog post tells the story of the
    project from the developer’s perspective. You can showcase the journey as well as the destination. This is a great
    way to communicate to others what contributions you actually made, which may not be clear from reporting the results
    of the project alone. It can be incredibly insightful for those wanting to learn more about the kind of work you do.
    It can start conversations around the project with people who can point out the things you missed or got wrong,
    giving you an opportunity to learn more. It can open new doors for collaborations and future projects. By
    communicating what you have done (in a digestible blog post), you have increased the total impact of the project
    without having done any additional technical work. Woohoo, efficiency!</p>
<h2>Perspective Matters</h2>
<p>While teaching lessons and telling stories about projects are practical examples of blog posts, they aren’t the only
    things you can write about. Your interests may vary; one post may be a reflection on a personal experience you had
    (e.g. the PhD application process), while another may be a casual presentation of your thoughts on some public event
    (e.g. NVIDIA’s $100B investment in OpenAI). Though the topics, style, and context of the posts may change, there is
    one constant throughline: the identity of the author! The blog as a whole is an outgrowth of the author’s
    perspective at large, structured so as to deliver meaningful information. This is what makes your blog different
    from say, a Wikipedia article on the same subject. The irreplaceable value of your blog is your unique quirks,
    thoughts, and identity.</p>
<p>So, if you’re thinking about starting a blog, I encourage you to do so! Your thoughts and ideas will be a valuable
    contribution to the world. </p>
